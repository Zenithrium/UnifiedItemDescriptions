# Unified Item Descriptions
Attempts to rephrase item descriptions in Seekers of the Storm to be more similar to previous item descriptions and to improve item effect clarity. 
Additionally, capitalizes CHEF in all relevant places, and changes 'enemies killed' to 'customers served' in relation to CHEF.

# Special Thanks
- Thank you to...
  - Domi, JestAnotherAnimator, orbeezeater22, swuffâ˜…, Slipskip, TheTimesweeper, as well as some friends and the rest of the SS2 Team for allowing me to run the lang changes by them.

# Clarification
I don't hold any ill will towards the SotS team of course, I mostly did this for myself because the inconsistent phrasings bother me, but some of these item effects are genuinely just hard to phrase. I of course referenced base game and SotV item descriptions, but they're not perfect either - be it the missing period in Razorwire's description or Oddly-Shaped Opal's text colors being cIsHealing instead of cIsUtility. Stuff like this happens!
